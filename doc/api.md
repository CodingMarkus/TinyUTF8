TinyUTF8 API Documentation
==========================

Terms used by TinyUTF8
----------------------

Throughout the API and this documentation certain terms are used frequently, whose definition may not match the definition you might expect and also won't match the definition how other libraries or even the Unicode standard itself define these terms. It's important to know these terms to understand the API and documentation correctly.

Terms and their definition can be found in [doc/terms.md](terms.md)
